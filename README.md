# pifi
The single library allows using directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and mediation logic. In other words, this library is a pico version of [Apache Nifi](https://nifi.apache.org). Why? In real life, there are a ton of use cases or requirements that requires processing data as data flows or streams, splitting the processing into several asynchronous stages and tasks, with a combination of schedulers, etc. And yes, Apache Nifi is a great tool that provides all of these things, but sometimes you can't use it (e.g., an additional component in architecture and infrastructure, resources, complexity, too big for tiny thingsâ€¦). 
But if you want these features, then you can use PIFI ;) The library without dependencies (maybe with one for logging;) ) that can be easy peasy included in any project or deployed to any app server.

# Requirements
- JDK 1.8
- Maven 3
- eclipse, idea,...

# Current status
- basically, the engine extracted from NIFI but without provenance
- in the following class ```$pifi/src/test/java/com/pifi/demo/PocFlowDemo.java``` , is a basic simple "demo" flow, where are three activities (processors), each of them connected via a relationship, *the idea behind this flow is to read files (polling directory) and process them asynchronously*

# TODO/what's next
- extract provenance
- support routing flowfiles via multiple relationships
- unit tests!!!
- more demos + improve docs
- and more
- github actions + release
